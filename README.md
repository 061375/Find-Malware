# Find-Malware
Simple Script to find PHP malware on a Linux/UNIX Server

This code can find backdoors, and content injection written in PHP. 
It does not look for complex attacks, such as root-kits.

## Simple Usage
1. Log into your website using SSH (ask your host provider if this is available)
2. Download/Upload Find-Malware code
3. Enter the Find-Malware folder:
   cd /path/to/Find-Malware
4. Type the following:
   php test.php /path/to/test/folder/ false

This will run a verbose version of the code that will not send an email if it finds anything.

For this to be effective you may need raised privileges.

## Suggestion
I would implement the email feature with your own code and if possible run this using a CRON at a low-volume time.
